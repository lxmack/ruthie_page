<h3> My Early Days</h3>
  <p> I was born somewhere in the South but I don't really remember it.
    I guess I am an orphan but I know I have at least one sister. We came up to New Jersey and stayed with a very nice lady.
    Then we went to Connecticut and I stayed with another nice lady because my new mom was traveling.
